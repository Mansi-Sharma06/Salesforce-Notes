Data Security: To avoid any unauthorized access from any user to the org, object, field, tab, record etc. We use data security.

We have 4 levels of security:
1. Organization level security: We can implement this in below 3 ways:
--> Password policies: 
--> Login Hours --> Users can login to their salesforce org only during the specific number of hours. 9am to 5pm.
--> Login IP Ranges --> IP address. 24.76.4.120 to 24.76.4.180

2. Object level security--> To secure the salesforce objects from unauthorized user access, we use object level security.
This can be implemented in 2 ways:
--> Profile --> It is used to give minimum level of access to the users. We can give Read, create, edit and delete permissions to the object through a profile.
Profile is of 2 types:
	--> Standard Profile --> It is created by salesforce and we cannot edit most of the permissions from a standard profile. 
	--> Custom Profile --> to edit the permissions, we clone the standard profile and we create a custom profile, which we can easily edit.

--> Permission Set 

Difference between Profile and Permission Set: Profile is used to give minimum level of access to the users. whereas permission set is used to give additional permissions(additional to profile)

Scenario : HR Department

Create a profile for a particular group of users. We create one single profile for whole HR department. We assign that profile to all 5 people below.

In that profile--> we have Read, edit, create and delete permission.

HR Senior Manager --> Read, edit, create, delete
HR Manager--> Read, create
HR Analyst--> Read 
HR Analyst--> Read
HR Analyst--> Read

3. Field level security: It is used to secure the fields from unauthorized access. This can be done using:
--> Profile
--> Permission set

We have 2 access levels for field level security:
	--> Read access
	--> Edit access

Permission set group: collection of permission sets
permission set 1 --> object --> position--> edit, delete 
permission set 2 --> object --> candidate --> create
permission set 3 --> field --> edit access

4. Record level security: it is used to avoid unauthorized access for the records or data. This can be done in 4 ways:
--> OWD(Organization Wide Defaults): We have 3 basic access levels in OWD:
	--> Private: the records will be visible and editable only to the record owner.
	--> public read only: the records will be visible to everyone but editable only by the record owner.
	--> public read write: the records will be visible and editable by everyone.
	--> Controlled by Parent: this access level will be available in the child objects only. ()

position ---> Job application
Parent --> position
Child --> job application --> Controlled by parent --> means whatever access we give to its parent object, same access will be applied to this object as well.

	--> Public Read/Write/Transfer --> this is only available in lead and case objects. These are standard objects.

With the help of below 3 features, we can expand the record accessibility to other users(other than record owner). For this, we need to make sure that OWD access level should be either private or public read only.
--> Role Hierarchy: Using Role Hierarchy, the records can be made visible and editable to the users who are above the record owner in the role hierarchy.

--> Sharing Rules: 
--> Manual Sharing

Users: Each user is having a single profile in the salesforce org. Through profile, we give different permissions to the user. 

User License: This is assigned to any user of the org. It depends on the user requirement, which license to opt for.

We can freeze a user or we can deactivate the user. What is the difference.
--> In both cases, the user cannot login to the Salesforce org.
--> While freezing the user, user still has the user license where as while deactivating the user, user license gets free and we can assign that user's license to some other user now.
