SLDS --> Salesforce Lightning Design System. 
LMS --> Lightning Message Service(Component communication between unrelated components)

Lightning Data Service(LDS): This service helps us to interact with the database without the need of Apex class. we can perform basic CRUD operations with LDS without the need of Apex class. 
--> If we want to fetch a single record from the database and display its details on LWC, then we can use LDS. Likewise, we can create, update and delete a single record by providing the record id. 

Lightning base components:
1. <lightning-record-form>
2. <lightning-record-edit-form>
